# Boostrap Portfolio 

This is the second homework assignment for the UPenn PLS Coding Bootcamp. This assignment required to create three .html files: index, portfolio, and contact. Each file has css bootstrap link to apply the navbar, responsive images, and grid system. These together created a portfolio that is responsive to different screen sizes. 

Here in this repository you will find the portfolio that demonstrates the use of responsiveness. 

Note: in the contact.html file, an open source code was used to creat the contact form: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/forms/contact/.
